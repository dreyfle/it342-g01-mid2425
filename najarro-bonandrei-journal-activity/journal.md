#### What I learned in Git
Despite having previous experiences with Git from personal and educational projects, we learned the proper execution (like the do's and dont's) of using Git itself and its commands or features. Like not using Windows Powershell when executing  Git commands, and the importance of the .git folder and its impact to your project.

#### What I'm still confused about in Git
I am still not confident and sure when dealing with branches and dealing with the HEAD concept in Git.

#### What I learned in Git
I learned the importance of using Git as a way to synchronize my progress between two devices. I am having a personal coding project related to my work as a Non-Academic scholar of CIT. Since I am working on my personal computer and my laptop, I used Git through Github to have synchronized files between two devices. This is very useful since it removes the effort of having to manually transfer files between my devices.

#### What I'm still confused about in Git
As of writing this, I did not have a thing I am confused with Git yet.

#### What I learned in Git
Today, I learned how to fork a repository. In my understanding, basically its re-creating an existing repository and saving it as your own copy of that repository. I'm assuming that it's similar to making a branch in Git. But instead of handling with branches, you are dealing with repositories itself. 

#### What I'm still confused about in Git
I am confused and slightly wondering what will happen when the owner of the existing repository adds an update to their repo (they pushed new commits), can we update our own fork of the repo with the changes they added? If so, how will it affect our forked repository?

#### What I learned in OAuth2
For this laboratory session, we were taught how to use basic OAuth2 authorization in a Spring Boot application. I learned how to add OAuth2 authorization for GitHub and Google accounts. I also learned the importance of the client-id and client-id-secret and how they must not be shared to the public.

#### What I'm still confused about in OAuth2
I am somewhat confused and curious how the behind the scenes work in OAuth2. I might look for a video explanation on how it works. Since my previous experience with Sessions was with JWT, I'm wondering if this also uses tokens and if it will also expire.

# DAILY JOURNAL UPDATE <br>
========================================<br>

## [Date: 06-18-2025]

**1. What did I accomplish yesterday?**
- Yesterday we had our Midterm Exams. It was a bit hard especially on the parts where I forgot how to implement some of the codes for the design patterns.

**2. What will I do today?**
- I will start creating the Requirements Gathering & Analysis assignment where I started making the initial files needed by our group which are the Word document file for the Functional & Non-Functional Requirements and the Use Case Diagram.

**3. Any blockers or challenges?**
- The challenge in making this was that my group mates do not have previous experience in making these deliverables.

========================================

## [Date: 06-19-2025]

**1. What did I accomplish yesterday?**
- I created the files needed for submission for the Requirement Analysis & Gathering assignment. I also disseminated them to my group mates for them to start making them with me.

**2. What will I do today?**
- I will finish up the assignment from yesterday especially the Use Case Diagram, where my group mates were having a hard time making.

**3. Any blockers or challenges?**
- The challenge in making this was that my group mates do not have previous experience in making these deliverables. Especially in some of the diagrams mentioned in the assignment.

========================================

## [Date: 06-20-2025]

**1. What did I accomplish yesterday?**
- I submitted the Requirement Analysis & Gathering assignment. It was submitted late, but only for a few seconds. The deadline was 11:59 and I submitted at exactly 11:59, but it was marked as late. It is what it is :)  

**2. What will I do today?**
- We were tasked to complete the implementation of Google People API, especially the creating, updating, and deleting of Contacts. Hopefully, I can finish all of them within today.

**3. Any blockers or challenges?**
- The difficulties I encountered was the part for updating of contacts. I am still on the process of troubleshooting the cause of the problems I encountered.

========================================

## [Date: 06-21-2025]

**1. What did I accomplish yesterday?**
- I successfully implemented the creating and deleting of contacts using the People API. Unfortunately, the updating part still has problems I plan to fix later on.

**2. What will I do today?**
- I plan to rest today after a very productive week. Since I am a Non-Academic Scholar (NAS), I am rendering my duties every morning and attend classes in the afternoon.

**3. Any blockers or challenges?**
- The challenge today is to fully commit to resting without having to worry about the project that we will be making some time next week. I really hope my group mates can be relied on during the project.

========================================

## [Date: 06-22-2025]

**1. What did I accomplish yesterday?**
- I had a mental health break after a week-long juggling of NAS duties and summer class. It was a well-deserved rest considering the hard work I put that week.

**2. What will I do today?**
- I will continue the implementation of Google People API for updating contacts in our lab activity. I will try to fix the persistent error from my work from two days ago. Hopefully, it will be solved.

**3. Any blockers or challenges?**
- One challenge I encountered was that because of the sense of urgency that I need to finish the activity, I did not completely read the API documentation. Hence, I could not correctly implement the API which resulted in errors. Luckily, I read it again and I successfully implemented it.
